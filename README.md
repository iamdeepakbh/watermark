# watermark
the code opens an input PDF file named "file1.pdf", loads a watermark image named "wtr.pdf", and adds the watermark image to every page in the input PDF file. The output is saved as a new PDF file named "watermarked_output.pdf.pdf". The PyPDF2 library provides the necessary functions to read and write PDF files, and to add an image to a PDF file as a watermark.
